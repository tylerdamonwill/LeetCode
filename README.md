# LeetCode Practice

I use this repository to track my progress as I begin remastering my technical interview, algorithm, data structure, and clean coding skills by completing daily LeetCode challenges. I'll add comments that explain my thought process or understandings of well known algorithms to display my approach when solving problemsalong with time complexity of the solution.

> Some solutions are suboptimal in time and/or space complexity. I've done this purposefully to write code that is efficient, but also readable.
